<h2>Modules</h2>

<p>This section introduces the functionality of the Tatool Web platform in order to get you started quickly. Depending on your assigned user roles, you can see and use the following parts of Tatool:</p>

<ul class="docContentList">
  <li><b>Modules:</b> Add and run Modules. The Modules are either publically available or you've been invited to participate in a private Module.</li>

  <li><b>Analytics:</b> Use the Analytics to monitor participation in your experiment with detailed data for every session (only available to researchers).</li>
  <li><b>Admin:</b> The Admin can manage users and projects through a convenient user interface (only available in your local installation).</li>
